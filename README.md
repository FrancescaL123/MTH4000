# MTH4000


During this module, I am currently learning new skills as a beginner of programming, such as plotting graphs, calculating values, defining and manipulating data variables, using sequences and lists, using data libraries (e.g. numpy, math and matplotlib), using slices, generators and built-in functions, using user-defined functions and lambda functions, using Boolean types and operators, using conditional statements (if), forming recursive functions, and finally using loops (e.g. while and for).
In addition to this, I will also be learning other topics e.g. algorithms, as well as building employment skills e.g. building a CV, a professional email address and LinkedIn. I hope to become a proficient programmer.
